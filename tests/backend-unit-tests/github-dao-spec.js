    /**********************************

     I M P O R T A N T:
     The github api was unpredictable for these tests and would fail intermittently.  We don't
     know if this was because of caching or a slow backend that would not recognize newly
     created repos or files.

     To get around the issue, we record the github data on a test, then mock the github http
     calls for testing.

     1) Run a single test with the following at the beginning of the test:
             nock.recorder.rec({});
     2) Create a function (e.g. mockDataxxxxx()) and copy the code generated in the log
        into the function (removing all non-code)
     3) Replace all instances of "access_token":xxxxx with "access_token":apiToken
     4) Comment out the call above to record the data, and call the newly created function.
